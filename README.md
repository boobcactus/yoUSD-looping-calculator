A calculator for yoUSD looping on Morpho Markets that uses live API data to compute net APY on deposits after multiple loops. It factors in current supply/borrow rates, yoUSD conversion rates, and enforces LTV limits. 

Results are approximations based on current rates and limited by API data availability.
